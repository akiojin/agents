# Core Package

The Core package contains the fundamental building blocks and utilities that power the Agents system. It provides essential infrastructure, type definitions, and shared functionality used throughout the platform.

## Features

- **Core Utilities**: Essential helper functions and utilities
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive type definitions for the entire system
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration handling
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and reporting
- **System Utilities**: Common system operations and utilities

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Type System**: Complete set of TypeScript interfaces and types
2. **Configuration Manager**: Centralized configuration handling and validation
3. **Utility Functions**: Common utility functions used across the system
4. **Error Handling Framework**: Standardized error handling with detailed logging
5. **System Interfaces**: Core interfaces that define system contracts

### System Flow

1. Components from other packages import core types and utilities
2. Configuration is loaded through the central configuration manager
3. System utilities provide shared functionality like logging and validation
4. Error handling follows standardized patterns throughout the system

## Key Concepts

### Type Safety
The core package ensures type safety across the entire system by:
- Providing comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Enforcing strict typing throughout the codebase
- Supporting generic and flexible type definitions

### Configuration Management
Centralized configuration management provides:
- Consistent access to system settings
- Validation of configuration values
- Support for multiple configuration sources

### Utility Functions
Core utilities include:
- Logging and debugging tools
- Data transformation and validation functions
- System information retrieval utilities

## Usage Examples

### Type Usage
```typescript
import { AgentConfig, ToolDefinition } from '@agents/core';

const config: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'Task Manager',
  model: 'gpt-4',
  tools: ['fileSystem', 'command']
};

const tool: ToolDefinition = {
  name: 'customTool',
  description: 'A custom tool for specific operations',
  parameters: {
    input: { type: 'string' }
  }
};
```

### Configuration Access
```typescript
import { getConfig } from '@agents/core/config';

// Get a specific configuration value
const apiKey = getConfig('OPENAI_LLM_KEY');

// Get all configuration as an object
const allConfig = getConfig();
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
import { createError } from '@agents/core/errors';

// Create a standardized error
const error = createError('AGENT_ERROR', 'Failed to initialize agent', {
  code: 'INIT_ERROR',
  details: { reason: 'Missing API key' }
});

// Log the error
console.error(error);
```

## Implementation Details

### Type Definitions
The core package provides a comprehensive set of types including:
- Agent and tool definitions
- Memory and context structures
- Configuration schemas
- Error handling interfaces

### Configuration System
The configuration system:
- Supports environment variables, config files, and runtime parameters
- Validates configuration values against defined schemas
- Provides centralized access to all system settings

### Utility Functions
Core utilities include:
- Logging functions with different severity levels
- Data validation and transformation helpers
- System information retrieval (OS, version, etc.)
- Error formatting and serialization

## Integration with Other Packages

### Type System Integration
All packages in the system use types defined in this package:
- Agents package uses core agent and tool interfaces
- Memory package uses core memory and context types
- CLI package uses core configuration and error types

### Configuration Management
The core configuration system is used by:
- Agent package to load and validate agent configurations
- CLI package to manage command-line configuration
- Adapter package for API provider settings

### Error Handling
The core error handling framework is used by:
- All packages to create and report errors consistently
- System monitoring and logging infrastructure
- User-facing error reporting

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Efficiency
The core package is designed to:
- Minimize memory footprint through efficient type definitions
- Use immutable data structures where appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary object creation in utility functions

### Configuration Loading
Configuration is optimized for:
- Fast loading and validation of configuration files
- Efficient lookup of configuration values
- Caching of parsed configuration data

### Utility Function Performance
Utility functions are optimized to:
- Avoid expensive operations in hot paths
- Use efficient algorithms for common operations
- Minimize external dependencies

## Extensibility

### Type Extensions
Developers can extend core types by:
- Creating custom interfaces that extend base types
- Adding new utility functions to the core system
- Implementing custom configuration schemas

### Configuration Extensions
The configuration system supports:
- Custom configuration providers (e.g., database-backed config)
- Environment-specific configuration overrides
- Hierarchical configuration management

This core package provides the foundation that enables all other packages to work together cohesively, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout the Agents system.
