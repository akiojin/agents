# Planning Package

The Planning package provides advanced planning capabilities for Agents. It enables agents to break down complex tasks into actionable steps, estimate resource requirements, and create detailed execution plans.

## Features

- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- **Resource Estimation**: Estimates time, cost, and tool requirements for tasks
- **Plan Generation**: Creates structured execution plans with dependencies
- **Dynamic Plan Adjustment**: Adapts plans based on runtime feedback and changes
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Supports coordination between multiple agents

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Plan Generator**: Creates structured execution plans from high-level goals
2. **Resource Manager**: Estimates and manages resource requirements
3. **Dependency Resolver**: Handles task dependencies and execution order
4. **Plan Executor**: Executes plans with progress tracking and feedback

### Planning Flow

1. User provides a high-level task or goal
2. Planner decomposes the task into subtasks with dependencies
3. Resource requirements are estimated for each subtask
4. A structured plan is generated with execution order
5. Plan is executed with real-time feedback and adjustments

## Key Concepts

### Plan Structure
Plans are represented as hierarchical task structures:
```json
{
  "id": "plan-123",
  "name": "Create Project Structure",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "name": "Create Directory Structure",
      "dependencies": [],
      "resources": {
        "time": "30m",
        "tools": ["fileSystem"]
      },
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resource Estimation
The system estimates resources using:
- Historical data from memory system (success/failure patterns)
- Task complexity analysis
- Tool-specific resource requirements

### Dynamic Adjustment
Plans can be adjusted in real-time based on:
- Task execution results
- Resource availability changes
- User feedback and requirements

## Usage Examples

### Basic Plan Generation
```typescript
import { Planner } from '@agents/planning';

const planner = new Planner();
const plan = await planner.generatePlan("Create a new React project with TypeScript");

// Execute the plan
const result = await planner.executePlan(plan);
```

### Resource-Aware Planning
```typescript
// Generate a plan with resource estimation
const detailedPlan = await planner.generatePlan(
  "Implement authentication system",
  {
    estimateResources: true,
    includeTimeEstimates: true,
    preferredTools: ["fileSystem", "command"]
  }
);
```

### Plan Modification
```typescript
// Modify an existing plan based on feedback
const updatedPlan = await planner.updatePlan(
  existingPlan,
  {
    task: "setupDatabase",
    status: "failed",
    reason: "Connection timeout"
  }
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Task Decomposition
The planner uses:
- Natural language processing to understand task requirements
- Memory system patterns for similar past tasks
- Tool availability analysis to suggest appropriate approaches

### Resource Management
Resource estimation considers:
- Historical task execution data from memory system
- Tool performance characteristics and availability
- System resource constraints (CPU, memory, etc.)

### Dependency Resolution
The system handles task dependencies through:
- Automatic detection of required prerequisites
- Ordering algorithms to ensure correct execution sequence
- Conflict resolution for overlapping resource requirements

## Integration with Other Packages

### Memory System Integration
The planner leverages memory system for:
- Past task execution patterns to improve estimates
- Error resolution patterns for better plan resilience
- Success/failure metrics for resource estimation

### Tool System Integration
The planner integrates with tools to:
- Identify appropriate tools for each subtask
- Estimate tool execution times and resource requirements
- Handle tool failures and alternative approaches

### Agent System Integration
The planning package works with:
- Core agents to execute individual plan steps
- Multi-agent coordination for complex plans
- Configuration management for planning preferences

## Performance Considerations

### Planning Efficiency
The planner is optimized for:
- Fast task decomposition using pattern matching
- Efficient resource estimation algorithms
- Minimal memory usage for plan structures

### Plan Execution
Execution performance considerations:
- Parallel execution of independent tasks where possible
- Efficient feedback loops for plan adjustments
- Caching of frequently used task patterns

### Scalability
The system supports:
- Large-scale plan generation for complex projects
- Distributed planning capabilities for multi-agent systems
- Incremental plan updates without full regeneration

## Extensibility

### Custom Planning Strategies
Developers can create custom planning strategies by:
- Implementing new decomposition algorithms
- Adding domain-specific planning rules
- Extending resource estimation with custom logic

### Plan Customization
The system supports:
- Custom plan formats and structures
- Domain-specific planning rules and constraints
- Integration with external planning tools or services

This planning package provides a robust foundation for task decomposition and execution planning, enabling agents to handle complex workflows with appropriate resource management and dynamic adjustment capabilities.
