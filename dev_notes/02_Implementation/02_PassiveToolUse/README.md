# Passive Tool Use - Current Status

## Problem Statement
Our testing indicates a limitation in the current implementation of passive tool use. While the Large Language Model (LLM) is capable of identifying the need for a tool and issuing a `tool_code` request, it appears unable to receive or process the `tool_output` from the execution of that tool.

## Current Behavior
1.  The LLM correctly analyzes the user's prompt and determines that a tool is required.
2.  The LLM generates a valid tool call request.
3.  The client-side environment successfully executes the tool and obtains a result.
4.  **Crucially, the result of the tool call is not being successfully passed back to the LLM in the subsequent turn.**

## Impact
This breaks the conversational flow when tool use is required. The model cannot answer questions or perform tasks that depend on the information returned by a tool. It is essentially "flying blind" after making a tool request.

## Next Steps
- Investigate the data flow between the tool execution environment and the `GenerativeModel`.
- Ensure that the tool's output is correctly formatted as a `functionResponse` part.
- Verify that the `history` of the conversation correctly includes the tool call result before the next `generateContent` call.
